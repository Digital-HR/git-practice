and turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet 
away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and 
was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper 
of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure 
position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby 
himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.

I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that 
would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him, for he gave a sudden
intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward
the dark, far as I was from him, I could have 
sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished 
nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been
the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I
was alone again in the unquiet darkness.

This is my second change, still think I'm doing this wrong.
